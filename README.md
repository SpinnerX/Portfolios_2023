### Compiler
Using ARM32 and C++ with a bit of C, I did a basic implementation of a compiler taught in the Computer Architecture class. Where we discussed about optimization techniques such as SIMD, Neon used with ARM32, pipelining, etc.

Using what we learned also about embedded systems and CPU's, implemented a basic compiler to generate the assembly code for us. Which essentially parses a command and generates the assembly and using that assembly to help us generate the output from C++ to ARM32, to output.

### Algorithm Visualizer

### Description
Visualizing and simulating graph theory algorithms. Algorithms visualization and ranges are from beginnner to intermediate to advance. Involving complex graphs. In the first phase we implement visualization of graph theory algorithms in a maze we create to see how the algorithms find the respective path from starting to the ending src nodes.
