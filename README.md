## Portfolios

### ProjectFormat
This project is just to allow testing for a format library I was currently in developing as there are things broken with it. As well the formatCpp
library needs a big refactoring with the current code base, as well the code does not fully have OS-compatibility features built-in just yet.

As these features will soon be implemented soon in the library, included with other features that I will have plans in the future. As the main focus
of this library will to be lightweight, and faster than using std::cout and std::cerr, and allow to use stderr and stdout while still allowing type-safety
for a much easier and readable code.

Haven't done the benchmarking yet for this library yet, but soon enough will be later on...
